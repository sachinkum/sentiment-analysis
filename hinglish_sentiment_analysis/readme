This is a Hinglish Sentiment Classifier, which first converts hinglish to hindi and then classifies the sentiment into positive, negative and neutral.
The Hinglish-Hindi converter is a custom encoder-decoder seq2seq network train on a small amount of data.
Hindi embeddings are taken from FastText embeddings since they are one of the largest available embeddings for Hindi.

hindi_sentiment_train contains the training code for the sentiment classifier.
get_sentiment contains the prediction code.

Both notebooks can be run end to end.

Make sure you download the FastText embeddings through the notebook.
